A Moodle block that integrates Moodle with SmarThinking (http://www.smarthinking.com)

This block allows instructors to place a link on course pages that allow Moodle users to login to SmarThinking using the same credentials as they use for Moodle.

INSTALLATION

IMPORTANT: Before using this block a Moodle Admin must add the Partner ID, Partner password and zipcode for the institutions SmarThinking access. This is done under Modules->Blocks->Manage blocks.

Since this block uses an asynchronous process to handle the SmarThinking login, Yahoo yui libraries are required. These are part of the current version's standard installation.
